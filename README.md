- The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python text-based game where the player tries to guess a secret number randomly generated between 1 and 20. The game starts by welcoming the player and informing them of the number range. The player has a maximum of 5 attempts to guess the secret number correctly. After each guess, the game provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.

- If the player correctly guesses the secret number within the allowed attempts, the game congratulates them and asks if they want to play again. If the player exhausts all attempts without guessing the correct number, the game informs them of the secret number and asks if they want to play again.

- The player can choose to continue playing the game or exit by entering `yes` or `no` when prompted to play again. The game loop repeats as long as the player wants to continue playing.

- The game offers a fun and interactive experience for players, challenging their guessing skills while providing opportunities for improvement in subsequent attempts.
